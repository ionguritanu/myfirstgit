        //Then ask the user to input the number of letters that word consists
        //Your code should print true if the user entered a right number of letters in the word, false if the wrong number is entered.
        //Then the code should ask to enter a letter that the user wants to find an index of.
        //Your code should print the index of the entered letter, if the word doesnâ€™t contain the letter then the code should print -1
        //Please look at two Examples below to understand how your code should work.
        //Enter a random word
        //Techtorial -> this line represents user's input Enter number of letter that word consists 10 -> this line represents user's input true Enter a letter that you want to find an index a -> this line represents user's input 8
        //
        //Second Example
        //
        //Enter a random word Java Enter number of letter that word consists 6 false Enter a letter that you want to find an index v 2



// Please do all coding here

        int word1 = word.length();

        boolean result = word1 == letterCount;

        System.out.println(result);



        System.out.println("Enter a letter that you want to find an index");

        System.out.println(word.indexOf(letter));






//System.out.println(word.indexOf(''));
// String abc = input.nextLine();
// int index;
// if (word.length() = abc.length();
